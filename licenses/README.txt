Purpose
-------
This directory contains the open-source license texts that must accompany
redistribution of the Simple Photo Meta application when packaged as binaries.
It is complementary to the repository-level THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt summary.

Maintenance
-----------
- Keep the license texts in sync with the actual versions you bundle.
- For Exiv2: verify which licensing option applies to your build
  (GPL-2.0+, GPL-3.0, or LGPL-3.0) and ensure the appropriate text is included.
- For PySide6/Qt: ensure LGPL-3.0 text is included and comply with LGPL
  requirements (dynamic linking, ability to relink, provide copy of license).
- For Pillow (HPND): upstream includes attribution lists; consult Pillow's
  LICENSE if stricter attribution is required for specific files.
